I'm far from a slob, but living in Pennsylvania, being a busy professional, throw in a dog and it's tough NOT to have a dirty vehicle.  AND who's got 2+ hours that they're willing to clean it?!?

By my surprise, S. Florida had such app and I thought my prayers had been answered!  Back to Pa I went with app en tow... err on phone.  To my dismay, said app only covered S. Florida, and after doing some research, the few other apps only covered a small region(s) too...",
        content_2: "I'm a software engineer and I love a good challenge.  I set off to learn more about the vehicle detailing industry.  After a few weeks of networking I met a gentleman who sells detailing products nationwide.  We setup a meeting and I told him my \"crazy\" idea of building an app so anyone, anywhere can find a detailer in their area, schedule an appointment and pay without leaving their home or office.  He grew a grin on his face like the Grinch imagining his next caper.  I could see the gears turning and that set off hours of " + 
        "brainstorming, which lead to weeks and months of planning, prototyping and developing." + 
        "\r\n\r\nAlong the way, I spent countless hours interviewing detailers, learning their pain points, the products they use, in what concentration, how they apply them and most of all how much pride they take in their work.  It was refreshing to speak with detailer after detailer and hear the exact same thing, which was, how much every detailer enjoyed taking someone's vehicle from its current state to showroom quality and then seeing the owner's face once they were finished.  I was and still am fired up to help these men & women!",

        lead: "Tis the season!  Not just for family gatherings and gift giving, but for snowy weather in the northern half of the United States and Canada!  Along with the snowy weather comes the life saving treatment, of our roads and bridges, in the form of salt!  Yes, salt which usually rims our favorite tequila drink, is now scattered along roadways to help make snowy roads passable.",
        content_1: "Nowadays, a new kid is on the block, when it comes to road deicing and his name is magnesium chloride.  Not familiar with this new band member?  Well you better be, b/c he's not only more efficient at deicing our roads, but he's also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221450951730030X\">horrible for our vehicles</a>.  Magesium chloride is significantly worse than traditional rock salt (sodium chloride), which has been used to cover our roads for decades.",
        content_2: "Magnesium chloride is typically used in liquid form and can be identified by the thin veritical lines that pin-stripe our roads when snow is in the forecast.  It's much more effective, because of a few traits.  First, it's in liquid form, so it is applied directly to roadways, instead of rock salt, which is flung onto roadways and is quickly scuttled to the median or side of the road.  Second, magesium chloride \"reacts\" in lower humidity (20-30%), as opposed to rock salt (70%), causing snow and ice to dissapate more effectively and at lower temperatures.  However, this is where things get acidic for our vehicles.  As magensium chloride reacts to the humidity it \"stick\" to everything, including our vehicles.  To add insult to injury the place we store our vehicles to protect them, our garage, incubate the corrosive process, by keeping temperates moderate enough to allow humidity above the 20-30% threshold.",
        content_3: "At this point you may be thinking, \"Ok, but what do I do about it?\".  Great question!  There are two great preventions, wax and sealants. Each should be applied to vehicles after a full exterior cleaning.  Wax and sealant work similarly by adding a protective barrier to your exterior.  If there are nicks, scratches or exposed metal they will cover those areas so the corrosive salt cannot attached to the underlying metal.  Keep in mind that corrosion has also been seen on plastics and rubber!  Ever wonder why windshield wipers don't last as long as they used too?!  I digress, back to the matter at hand.  To help protect your vehicle, once it's covered, is by hosing it down with some high quality h20 (in my best Waterboy voice).  Within a week or so after being exposed, hook up your garden hose, pressure washer or head to the local manual car wash and \"hose down\" the exterior of your vehicle AND most importantly the undercarriage of your vehicle.  If possible, use high pressure water, to rinse off the briny mixture.  With a good wax and/or sealant most of the salt should come right off.  DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT, go through an automated car wash!  The soap used WILL REMOVE any wax or sealant applied (unless it's a ceramic coating), nullifying it's effectiveness.  ADDITIONALLY, some car washes recycle water!  Nothing like removing your vehicles protective layer and then having the car wash coat your ENTIRE VEHICLE with magesium chloride...",
        content_4: "Our vehicles are an expensive part of our lives and we want them to last as long as possible.  Rust and other types of corrosion are preventable by investing some time and effort to our vehicles.  Cleaning and protecting your vehicle is a time-consuming process and requires the appropriate products and application.  However, spending a few hours on your vehicles can save $1,000s of dollars in the long run AND keep it looking newer, longer!  If your vehicle hasn't been protected, yet, it's NOT too late!  If you don't have the time or inclination to properly maintain your vehicle, download the Kleancierge app, schedule an appointment and let our professional detailers take care of it, so you can have some peace of mind during the holiday season.  Happy holidays from Kleancierge!",

Where do we want our business to go and how do we get it there?  Once internal goals are set they break them down into achievable pieces and allocate them, throughout the year, to the appropriate personnel and departments.  They know that the year long goals seems much more achievable and less overwhelming, if they're smaller, consumable chunks.  Furthermore, they're adding incentives to the \"pot\".  Company lunches, gift cards, bonuses, tickets and concierge services are some of the incentives provided when goals are met.",

During the appointment my detailer asked for me to look at something with him.  It was a speckled, gray area on my blue exterior (photo).  I remembered the area immediately, because a pile of bird sh*t was laying there for a couple days as I waited for it to rain.  My laziness caused the bird droppings to etch the clear coat of my paint, which could not be fixed during my appointment.  Learn from my mistake and hose off any bird droppings ASAP and add some elbow grease, if needed.  The same idea can be applied to interior spills.  When remedied as soon as possible these marks can be made temporary.  When left untreated they can become permanant or expensive to get rid of.  Moral of the story?  Be proactive and you'll save yourself money and heartache.",

These are earth shattering items, but they really come in handy when the situation calls.  For me these items are; jumper cables, a rain-resistent jacket, a warm jacket, a hat, an umbrella, a roll of quarters, aspirin, napkins and snacks, in case my fiance is hangry...  As you can tell I don't have children, but if you do, you know what's needed to short-circuit a break down...  Make sure you have it.\r<h3>4.  Detail your vehicle (at least) twice a year</h3>Living in the northeast we get distinct weather changes between Spring, Summer, Fall & Winter.  Each season effects our vehicles in different ways.  I prefer to get a VIP detail, twice a year, before and after Winter.  Before Winter is to remove all debris from the interior & exterior and most importantly treat the exterior paint and wheels with a wax and sealant, respectively, to protect them from road salts (reference <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/#/post/2/view\">Salt Is For Margaritas NOT Your Vehicle</a>).  After Winter, to remove the salt build up, remove and replace the wax and sealant and get an evaluation on the current state of my interior and exterior from my detailer.  Vehicles are an expensive part of adulthood and we hope to maximize our vehicle's mileage, while maintaining it's aesthetics.  Keeping the interior and exterior in good condition is imperative.  Finally, I work really hard, rarely have free time, spend a good amount of time in my vehicle and care about my appearance.  In my mind, there's not many things better than my vehicle looking and smelling brand new without me having to lift a finger.",
        content_4: "<h3>5. Follow regular maintenance</h3>This is something preached by Mom & Dad, Grandma & Grandpa and your mechanic alike.  However, today we have this handy gadget called a cell phone that's more closely related to a computer than traditional phone.  A key feature of most smart phones is an integrated calendar.  Life is busy, but when you schedule events you can be reminded (multiple times) and NOT double book.  Do yourself a favor in the new year and set a calendar reminder for the following three things related to your vehicle: Oil Change - every 3 months.  State Inspection - 30 days before it expires.  Full Detail Appointment - every March 1st & November 1st.  Take the guesswork and surprise out of the equation for these three items and reap the long-term benefits.\r<h3>Bonus - Take a different route to work once a week</h3>This is something I've done for the past three years and I love doing it...  I'm the creative type that loves trying different things.  Variety is the spice of life and though taking a different route to work doesn't sound very sexy, it's requires you to either a.) plan ahead on which route you're going to take or b.) \"play it by ear\" and figure it out when you get in the car that morning.  Either way you'll see different sights, activate your brain on an otherwise mundane drive and give yourself a few extra minutes of NPR or Howard Stern.",

For the sake of argument we're going to compare an automated car wash and a mobile detail appointment since they share one common thing; CONVENIENCE.",
        content_1: "I know the elephant in the room is cost of these services, but we're going to hold off on that topic until we talk details.  In this episode, we're focusing on the process of cleaning the exterior of your vehicle.  During an automated car wash you drive into a bay where you park your vehicle, crank up your radio, and jam out during the 5-10 minute service.  High pressure water is first used to knock off dirt and debris and wet the surface.  Vehicles have many nooks and crannies so mechanical arms do their best to most of the vehicle.  Soap is then sprayed on good portion of the vehicle.  High pressure water is then used to remove the soap and, if selected, a liquid wax or sealant is applied.  IF you use an automated wash that touches your vehicle, with those rotating brushes or moving fabric strips, STOP!!!  Ya know the last person and the person before them AND the person before them?  Well the dirt and debris from their vehicles are attached to those brushes/fabrics and they're now scratching the shit out of your paint job.  Back to the no touch wash...  To finish the service you drive your through an industrial blower, in 25 seconds or less, to \"remove\" some of the water on your vehicle's surface.  This process is quick and easy.  However, have you ever noticed how much of the dirt, bugs, road paint and other debris was actually removed from your vehicle, especially around the sides of the vehicle?  Not much, and further more if you examine AFTER the vehicle dries you'll notice the wash wasn't thorough at all.  My parent use to call this fools gold...",
        content_2: "During a mobile vehicle detail a real, human will come to your home or office to provide the service.  This humanoid will first meet with you to get any specifics about the vehicle and ask questions about its usage.  The reason?  Each vehicle is different and is used differently.  If your car is a \"daily driver\" the detailer can recommend a wax and sealant combo along with a windshield treatment to help with bugs and road paint.  Furthermore, the detailer will review your vehicle and provide feedback on its current state, like the bird poop that etched into your clear coat.  To start, high pressure water will be used to wet your vehicle.  This is similar to the automated wash, but every inch is covered, since ya know, the detailer is not a machine.  Next your vehicle will be thoroughly washed either by hand.  This is the first level of what's referred as decontamination, where the detailer will use a microfiber mitt and one or two buckets of water.  The detailer will dip the mitt into the buckets after each pass of cleaning to transfer the debris from your vehicle, to the mitt, to the bucket(s).  This process is important, because the debris from your vehicle get \"deposited\" in the bucket(s) before the mitt is reapplied to your vehicle's surface.  Once the hand wash is completed your vehicle is pressure rinsed again to remove the soap.  One of the dirtiest part of a vehicle are the wheels and tires.  This is caused by their direct contact with the ground and the accumulation of brake dust.  Wheels are cleaned with different products that specializes in removal of these contaminants.  These products are sprayed on and left to sit for them to work properly.  Once ready the detailer will use a brush to thoroughly clean the wheels and drums.  The tires rinsed and then \"dressed\" with a gel, specifically for tires, that will leave them dark black, will condition the rubber and protect them from UV rays, which can cause tires to lose flexibility.",
        content_3: "Your vehicle is now ready for the final phase of decontamination using clay bar.  This Silly Putty-looking substance is lightly drug across your paint and glass to remove dirt and debris that is fiercely attached to microscopic imperfections.  The clay actually reaches into these crevices and grabs the dirt/debris.  As the detailer moves to different sections of the vehicle they'll fold the putty to a clean side.  This step is incredibly important, because it creates a perfectly clean surface for the detailers to apply a sealant and/or wax.  The application of the wax and/or sealant is also done by hand and thoroughly covers the entirety of the vehicle's exterior, including windows.  These products adhere directly to the paint and its crevices to create a barrier that both protects the paint AND provides a shine that's unmatched. This barrier will protect your vehicle for a month or more depending on driving conditions and maintenance.  Your vehicle now has a showroom quality shine and is protected from the elements.  Finally, your detailer will ask you to evaluate the vehicle, they will also point out any issues that require paint correction (future article) or paint-less dent repair (future article) and recommend how to maintain the exterior of the vehicle, until you see them again.",
        content_4: "Now to price and duration.  The automated car wash took about 15 minutes to \"wash\" and cost about $10.  The mobile vehicle detail took 2-3 hours and cost about $150-$200, based on where you live and vehicle size.  \n" +
            "\n" +
            "So what's the takeaway?  A car wash does a poor job of quickly \"cleaning\" the exterior of your vehicle for cheap.  Ya get what ya pay for...  A mobile detail is an investment into one of your most valuable assets.  Though it seems more expensive, it's value far exceeds that of an automated wash by providing a human evaluation of your vehicle's current state, a thorough decontamination of the exterior, protective barriers and a lustrous, showroom quality shine that will turn heads.
