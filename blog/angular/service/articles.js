        lead: "\"Siiiiiighhhhh.  Ok I'll take care of this tonight.\" This is what I said to myself every morning as I walked to my vehicle and got in.  I'm far from a slob, but living in Pennsylvania, being a busy professional, throw in a dog and it's tough NOT to have a dirty vehicle.  AND who's got 2+ hours that they're willing to clean it?!?  I'd rather go for a run, spend time w/ loved ones, relax, watch football, I could go on and on with things I'd rather do than wash my vehicle...",
        content_1: "Then, on a trip to south Florida, to visit my brother and his fiance at the time, I was having a conversation with friends about how there's NOT an app to schedule a mobile detailing appointment like hailing a ride with Uber or Lyft...  By my surprise, S. Florida had such app and I thought my prayers had been answered!  Back to Pa I went with app en tow... err on phone.  To my dismay, said app only covered S. Florida, and after doing some research, the few other apps only covered a small region(s) too...",
        content_2: "I'm a software engineer and I love a good challenge.  I set off to learn more about the vehicle detailing industry.  After a few weeks of networking I met a gentleman who sells detailing products nationwide.  We setup a meeting and I told him my \"crazy\" idea of building an app so anyone, anywhere can find a detailer in their area, schedule an appointment and pay without leaving their home or office.  He grew a grin on his face like the Grinch imagining his next caper.  I could see the gears turning and that set off hours of " + 
        "brainstorming, which lead to weeks and months of planning, prototyping and developing." + 
        "\r\n\r\nAlong the way, I spent countless hours interviewing detailers, learning their pain points, the products they use, in what concentration, how they apply them and most of all how much pride they take in their work.  It was refreshing to speak with detailer after detailer and hear the exact same thing, which was, how much every detailer enjoyed taking someone's vehicle from its current state to showroom quality and then seeing the owner's face once they were finished.  I was and still am fired up to help these men & women!",
        content_3: "That brings us to today, about 2 years after I first started working on Kleancierge.  The Kleancierge platform is finally live in York, Pa (my home town), the Potomac, MD area and Orlando, FL.  Vehicle owners are learning about the app through social media, google searches, word of mouth, my smiling face and this blog.  Appointments are being scheduled, completed and vehicle owners could not be happier!  Detailers are being found and doing what they do best!",
        content_4: "However, this is only the first inning.  There's a big world out there and it's filled with dirty vehicles, owners with better things to do and professional detailers waiting to bring a smile to their face.  If you're a vehicle owner, with a dirty vehicle, download the app and schedule an appointment!  Stop waiting, because you deserve a smile on your face!",

        lead: "Tis the season!  Not for family gatherings and gift giving, but for snowy weather in the northern half of the United States and Canada!  Along with the snowy weather comes the life saving treatment, of our roads and bridges, in the form of salt!  Yes, salt which usually rims our favorite tequila drink, is now scattered along roadways to help make snowy roads passable.",
        content_1: "Nowadays, a new kid is on the block, when it comes to road deicing and his name is magnesium chloride.  Not familiar with this new band member?  Well you better be, b/c he's not only more efficient at deicing our roads, but he's also horrible for our vehicles.  Magesium chloride is significantly worse than traditional rock salt (sodium chloride), which has been used to cover our roads for decades.",
        content_2: "Magnesium chloride is typically used in liquid form and can be identified by the thin veritical lines that pin-stripe our roads when snow is in the forecast.  It's much more effective, because of a few traits.  First, it's in liquid form, so it is applied directly to roadways, instead of rock salt, which is flung onto roadways and is quickly scuttled to the median or side of the road.  Second, magesium chloride \"reacts\" in lower humidity (20-30%), as opposed to rock salt (70%), causing snow and ice to dissapate more effectively and at lower temperatures.  However, this is where things get acidic for our vehicles.  As magensium chloride reacts to the humidity it \"stick\" to everything, including our vehicles.  To add insult to injury the place we store our vehicles to protect them, our garage, incubate the corrosive process, by keeping temperates moderate enough to allow humidity above the 20-30% threshold.",
        content_3: "At this point you may be thinking, \"Ok, but what do I do about it?\".  Great question!  There are two great preventions, wax and sealants. Each should be applied to vehicles after a full exterior cleaning.  Wax and sealant work similarly by adding a protective barrier to your exterior.  If there are nicks, scratches or exposed metal they will cover those areas so the corrosive salt cannot attached to the underlying metal.  Keep in mind that corrosion has also been seen on plastics and rubber!  Ever wonder why windshield wipers don't last as long as they used too?!  I digress, back to the matter at hand.  To help protect your vehicle, once it's covered, is by hosing it down with some high quality h20 (in my best Waterboy voice).  Within a week or so after being exposed, hook up your garden hose, pressure washer or head to the local manual car wash and \"hose down\" the exterior of your vehicle AND most importantly the undercarriage of your vehicle.  If possible, use high pressure water, to rinse off the briny mixture.  With a good wax and/or sealant most of the salt should come right off.  DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT, go through an automated car wash!  The soap used WILL REMOVE any wax or sealant applied (unless it's a ceramic coating), nullifying it's effectiveness.  ADDITIONALLY, some car washes recycle water!  Nothing like removing your vehicles protective layer and then having the car wash coat your ENTIRE VEHICLE with magesium chloride...",
        content_4: "Our vehicles are an expensive part of our lives and we want them to last as long as possible.  Rust and other types of corrosion are preventable by investing some time and effort to our vehicles.  Cleaning and protecting your vehicle is a time-consuming process and requires the appropriate products and application.  However, spending a few hours on your vehicles can save $1,000s of dollars in the long run AND keep it looking newer, longer!  If your vehicle hasn't been protected, yet, it's NOT too late!  If you don't have the time or inclination to properly maintain your vehicle, download the Kleancierge app, schedule an appointment and let our professional detailers take care of it, so you can have some peace of mind during the holiday season.  Happy holidays from Kleancierge!",
